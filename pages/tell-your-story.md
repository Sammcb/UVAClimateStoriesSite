**Everyone has a climate change story** - Climate change affects all of us at UVA and beyond, and you do not need to be a scientist or policy expert in order to share your climate story. You just need to care about the place you live and share your observations of the changes around you and how you are responding to them. Your stories will help give others a better understanding of how climate change is happening now and will hopefully inspire action from UVA leadership to confront the climate crisis.
**We are excited to share your climate story, or carry out an interview with you to record and share your story.**

## 1. Plan your climate story

There is no one right way to tell your climate story. However, the most successful stories weave personal experiences into the larger issue of our changing climate. You may find that answering the following questions helps you craft your story:
* Where are you from? What in your local environment or community is impacted by climate change?
* How does climate change threaten people and places that you care about?
* Describe the moment when you realized that climate change was affecting your life. How did you feel? 
* Has climate change impacted your personal and profession actions and choices? How often do you think about climate change in your daily life?
* Describe your emotional responses to climate change as you think about yourself, your family, and your community.
* If you could say anything to UVA leadership about their environmental policies and practices, what would it be and why?

## 2. Record your climate story

You can record your climate story directly to your computer, to a smartphone, or other digital recording device. Find a quiet space and make sure to test recording levels and sound quality first. When you record your climate story, aim for between 2 to 3 minutes in length. Before uploading your story (below), please listen to your recorded climate story to make sure it is recorded at a proper volume and is intelligible.

Please make sure your video is clear, not grainy or blurry. You should be centered in the shot with the top half of your body visible. An example shot is attached for reference.

## 3. Upload your video

Upload your video [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdavzAw08OGcr8ROhXMrD-teGbQiiCNVE7FgHmEQidzPcYyUg/viewform?usp=sf_link)! Video transcripts will be displayed on the UVA Climate Stories instagram, and will be used to create a culminating short film at the end of the semester!

If you have any questions, please contact us. You can also request a person-to-person interview on the phone or online. We will hopefully be hosting pop-up storytelling events on grounds throughout the semester, so there will be lots of opportunities to get involved!
