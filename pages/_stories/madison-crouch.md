"For pretty much my entire life I've been really interested in the outdoors, my parents would take me and my sister hiking and camping a lot every summer growing up. Recently I've gotten into long distance backpacking and I think that that has really helped me understand even more about how climate change is affecting our natural places. 

One of the biggest marks of climate change on the trail is wildfires, especially out west. There weren't any wildfires while I was on the Arizona Trail because it was their wet season, but I definitely walked through places that had been burned recently. You can't camp there, it really affects all the wildlife there. Stuff does grow up underneath the burned area eventually, but it really decimates the whole landscape and it's pretty crazy how prevalent these wildfires are now. 

And the water situation - there's just some really dry areas, you can't really survive there. Even the native plants and animals are affected by that so it's very obvious when you go to these natural areas that climate change is real and that something needs to be done.

I haven't done the [Pacific Crest Trail] yet, but every year people have to skip sections due to wildfires. It's pretty much impossible now to do a full through hike without having to get off because of the fires. And it is scary, it's not that these areas haven't faced fire before but it's just getting worse. 

I don't know how long these natural places are going to be here. I'm fortunate enough to be able to go to these places now, but who knows in the future? Just in my lifetime, a lot of the glaciers have been melting - not just far away but in Montana [in Glacier National Park]. That's not such a far off place and you can go there and really see the effects of climate change. It does make me sad and angry but I know there's things that everyone can do to help save these natural places. You can't just sit idly by and hope that others can make change, you have to make the change yourself.

UVA leadership needs to reflect the environmental values that the students and faculty hold."
