"I'm from the Hampton Roads area in Virginia and the image that I associate the most with climate change from my home town is coal. I grew up in a primarily low income black neighborhood located pretty near a major coal terminal. From a young age, I can remember that older people and little kids in the neighborhood often developed lung issues. I came from a non-smoking family and still developed Asthma and Chronic Bronchitis at a young age. It never occurred to me when I was young that these things were possibly connected, but now that I'm in school and studying a lot about the intersections of class, race, and climate change, I am learning that this isn't an isolated incident. I feel frustrated that people of color, particularly low income people of color, continue to be disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change and injustices and yet, have the least political say in it. Of course, growing up in Hampton Roads, I also think a lot about the quickly rising sea levels and the long-term impacts of fossil fuel use, but I always find myself mostly concerned with the communities, in and outside of the U.S., who are closest to the situation now, because of where I grew up and what I'm studying, and I think that whatever I do in the future has to be about environmental justice for that reason."
